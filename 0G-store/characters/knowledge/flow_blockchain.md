# Flow Blockchain

Flow is a fast, decentralized, and developer-friendly blockchain, designed as the foundation for a new generation of games, apps, and the digital assets that power them. It is built to support the scale of mainstream consumer applications and the needs of developers building on top of it.

## Key Features

- **Multi-role architecture**: Separates consensus from computation, allowing the network to scale without reducing decentralization or breaking up the shared state.
- **Resource-oriented programming**: Introduces Cadence, a resource-oriented programming language that enforces ownership rules for digital assets at the language level.
- **Developer ergonomics**: Designed with developers in mind, making it easier to build secure blockchain applications.
- **Consumer onboarding**: Built-in features for mainstream user-friendly onboarding and account management.

## Cadence Programming Language

Cadence is a resource-oriented programming language that introduces a strong ownership model which uniquely protects digital assets. It helps developers ensure that their code is safe, secure, clear, and approachable.
