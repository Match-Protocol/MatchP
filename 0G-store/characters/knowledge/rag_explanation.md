# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that enhances large language models by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources before generating responses.

## How RAG Works

1. **Information Retrieval**: When a query is received, the system searches through a knowledge base to find relevant documents or information.

2. **Semantic Search**: Using vector embeddings, the system can find contextually relevant information even if exact keywords don't match.

3. **Content Chunking**: Documents are split into manageable chunks for more precise retrieval.

4. **Augmented Generation**: The retrieved information is combined with the original query to generate an accurate, informed response.

## Benefits of RAG

- **Up-to-date Information**: Allows access to the latest information beyond the model's training data.
- **Reduced Hallucinations**: Lowers the chance of generating incorrect information by grounding responses in verified data.
- **Domain Specificity**: Enables specialized knowledge in particular domains without fine-tuning the entire model.
- **Source Citations**: Can provide references to source materials for verifiability.

## RAG Implementation

RAG systems typically use vector databases to store and retrieve document embeddings efficiently. The process involves:
- Document ingestion and preprocessing
- Embedding generation
- Semantic search capabilities
- Context integration with the LLM prompting system
